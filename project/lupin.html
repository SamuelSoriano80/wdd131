                    Maurice Marie Émile Leblanc (11 December 1864 – 6 November 1941) was a French novelist and writer of short stories, known primarily as the creator of the fictional gentleman thief and detective Arsène Lupin, often described as a French counterpart to Arthur Conan Doyle's creation Sherlock Holmes.

                <p><strong>Summary:</strong> 
                    Arsène Lupin, Gentleman Burglar (French: Arsène Lupin, gentleman-cambrioleur) is the first collection of stories by Maurice Leblanc recounting the adventures of Arsène Lupin, released on 10 June 1907. It contains the first nine stories depicting the character, first published in the French magazine Je sais tout, the first one being on 15 July 1905. The seventh features English detective Sherlock Holmes, changed in subsequent publications to "Herlock Sholmes" after protests from Arthur Conan Doyle's lawyers, as seen in the second collection Arsène Lupin versus Herlock Sholmes

            <h2>Personal Review</h2>
            <p>I know this one is cheating considering that it has several stories in it, but this collection is just so good. Arsene's personality is charming and his cunning intellect makes every situation a tense one, overall, at most parts of the book you suspect that he may have used a trick of some sort but you are surprised when it was so much more than you could have thought of.</p>
