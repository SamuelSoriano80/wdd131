                <p><strong>Summary:</strong> 
                    Hill House is a mansion in a location never specified, surrounded by hills. Dr. John Montague, an investigator of the supernatural; Eleanor Vance, a shy young woman who resents caring for her demanding, disabled mother; Theodora, a bohemian artist; and Luke Sanderson, the young heir to Hill House; meet there at Montague's behest. Montague hopes to find scientific evidence of the existence of the supernatural. He rents Hill House for a summer and invites as his guests several people whom he has chosen because of their experiences with paranormal events. Of these, only Eleanor and Theodora accept.
                    <br><br>Eleanor travels to the house, where she and Theodora will live in isolation with Montague and Luke. The house's two caretakers, Mr. and Mrs. Dudley, refuse to stay near the house at night. The four overnight visitors begin to form friendships as Montague explains the building's history, which encompasses suicide and other violent deaths.All four of the inhabitants begin to experience strange events while in the house, including unseen noises and ghosts roaming the halls at night, strange writing on the walls, and other unexplained events. 
                    <br><br>Eleanor tends to experience phenomena to which the others are oblivious. At the same time, Eleanor may be losing touch with reality, and it is implied that at least some of what Eleanor witnesses may be products of her imagination. Another implied possibility is that Eleanor possesses a subconscious telekinetic ability that is itself the cause of many of the disturbances experienced by her and the others, which might indicate there is no ghost in the house at all. This possibility is suggested especially by references early in the novel to Eleanor's childhood memories about episodes of a poltergeist-like entity that seemed to target her home.

            <h2>Personal Review</h2>
            <p>I love this book, this is a very high novel to start my top 3, any who likes horror story may already know this one because of how influential it was for modern horror. The Haunting of Hill house is a great story because it places you into the eyes of the inhabitants, speacially Eleanor, as such you start to question if Hill House is really haunted or if everything can be explained through science.</p>
